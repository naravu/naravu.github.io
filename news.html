            <p><p>It is one of the world’s most vital carbon sinks, but this tropical rainforest is losing out when it comes to climate policy and funding</p><p>In October 2023, leaders, scientists and policymakers from <a href="https://www.thethreebasinsummit.org/">three of the world’s great rainforest regions</a> – the Amazon, the Congo, and the Borneo-Mekong basins – assembled in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo. They were there to discuss one urgent question: how to save the planet’s last great tropical forests from accelerating destruction.</p><p>For those present, the question was existential. But to their dismay, almost no one noticed. “There was very little acknowledgment that this was happening, outside of the Congo basin region,” says Prof Simon Lewis, a lecturer at the University of Leeds and University College London, and co-chair of the <a href="https://congobasinscience.net/">Congo Basin Science Initiative</a> (CBSI).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/18/congo-basin-rainforest-africa-research-funding-aoe">Continue reading...</a></p>

[But] they don’t really know what is the problem really. They’re taking the decisions from their own mind and the problem is that they’re far from reality.</p><p>That’s why we decided to alert the people in the world about [our] problems: water coming up, getting enough to eat, more heat – in some parts of French Guiana, people don’t have water.</p><p>These crises, a consequence of Western capitalist madness, primarily affect the most vulnerable: women and communities dependent on forests and rivers. But they also concern all of humanity: French Guiana is part of the Amazon, a regulator of the global climate and essential to planetary balance.</p><p>We remind you that French Guiana is the last colony in South America without self-determination. We will not be able to protect our environment or guarantee our food and energy self-sufficiency, essential for our collective survival, as long as decisions are made in Paris without consulting the affected communities or taking into account local specificities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2025/nov/20/cop30-live-news-updates-belem-brazil-president-lula">Continue reading...</a></p>
