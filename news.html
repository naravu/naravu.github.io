            <p>‘‘இங்குள்ள முன்னாள் அமைச்சர் செந்தில் பாலாஜிக்கு 10 ரூபாய் பாலாஜி என்று மக்கள் பேர் வைத்திருக்கிறார்கள். மக்களிடம் கொள்ளையடித்த பணத்தையே மக்களிடம் கொடுத்து ஓட்டு வாங்கி, மீண்டும் ஆட்சிக்கு வந்து கொள்ளையடிப்போம் என்று திட்டம் போட்டிருக்கிறார். அவரது திட்டத்துக்கு யாரும் விலை போய்விடாதீர்கள்’’</p>
