            <p><p>Flood warning raised to highest level with roads washed away and rain forcing evacuation of Kruger national park</p><p>Large areas of north-eastern South Africa and neighbouring Mozambique have been inundated for several days with exceptionally heavy rainfall. Some locations in South Africa recorded hundreds of millimetres of rain over the weekend, such as Graskop in Mpumalanga, where 113mm fell in 24 hours, and Phalaborwa, which recorded about 85mm of rainfall. Rain has continued to fall across the region since the weekend.</p><p>The deluge has been driven by a slow-moving cut-off low pressure system that has remained anchored over the region, repeatedly drawing in moisture and triggering intense downpours. Further heavy rainfall is expected on Friday and over the weekend. Maputo, Mozambique’s capital, could expect daily rainfall totals to exceed 200mm by the end of Friday, while western parts of South Africa and north-western Eswatini may record more than 100mm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/16/weather-tracer-extreme-rainfall-inundates-south-africa-mozambique-flood-warning">Continue reading...</a></p>
